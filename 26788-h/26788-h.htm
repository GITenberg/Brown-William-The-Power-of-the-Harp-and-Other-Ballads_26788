5</span>BROWN WILLIAM</h2>
<p><i>This ballad was written in consequence of the execution of
William Christian</i>, <i>generally called William Donn</i>,
<i>or Brown William</i>, <i>from the darkness of his
complexion</i>, <i>who was shot at Hango Hill</i>, <i>near
Castletown</i>, <i>in the Isle of Man</i>, <i>shortly after the
Restoration</i>, <i>for alleged treason to the Derby family</i>,
<i>who long possessed the sovereignty of Man</i>. . . .<i> The
ballad of</i> &ldquo;<i>Brown William</i>,&rdquo; <i>which gives
an account of the betrayal of the poor patriot</i>, <i>and the
vengeance taken by the hand of God upon his murderers</i>, <i>is
the most popular of all the wild songs of Ellan Vannin</i>.</p>
<p>Let no one in greatness too confident be,<br />
Nor trust in his kindred, though high their degree;<br />
For envy and rage will lay any man low:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>Thou wast the Receiver of Mona&rsquo;s fair state,<br />
Thy conduct was noble, thy wisdom was great,<br />
And ne&rsquo;er of thy rule did she weariness show:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Thy right hand was Earley, and Theah thy right eye;<br />
Thy state caused thy foemen with rage to swell high;<br />
And envy and rage will lay any man low:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>How blest thy condition in fair Ronaldsway!<br />
Thy mansion, how stately! thy garden, how gay!<br />
But oh! what disasters from envy do flow:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas said at thy trial, by men void of faith,<br />
The king, by a letter, demanded thy death;<br />
The jury was frighten&rsquo;d, and dared not say
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>The clan of wild Colcad could ne&rsquo;er be at rest<br />
Whilst the race of Christeen their own acres possess&rsquo;d;<br
/>
And envy and spite will bring any man low:<br />
Thy murder Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>A band of adulterers, curst and unholy,<br />
For Ronaldsway lust, as they did for Logh Molley;<br />
Of Naboth, the tragedy&rsquo;s played here anew:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>Not one of the band but received his just meed,<br />
Who acted a part in that damnable deed;<br />
To dwindle away the whole band was not slow:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>To Callaghyn-doo, and to Vannyster roam,<br />
And call on the Colcad till hoarse ye become;<br />
Gone, gone is the name so well known long ago:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>A cripple was Robin for many years long,<br />
Who troubled and bullied the island when strong;<br />
His own friends of tending him weary did grow:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Sly Richard took ship with thy blood on his hand,<br />
But God can avenge on the sea as on land;<br />
The waves would not bear him, but whelm&rsquo;d him, I trow:<br
/>
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>And now, if a few of the seed do remain,<br />
They&rsquo;re vile as the thistles and briars of the plain;<br />
They ply for their neighbours the pick and the hoe:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>Should ye walk through all Man you&rsquo;ll find no one, I
reckon,<br />
To mourn for the name that was once in Beemachan;<br />
But thousands of poor who rejoice that &rsquo;tis low:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

But where&rsquo;s there a Colcad to bid ye walk in?<br />
By strangers their homes and their lands are held now:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>Great Scarlett, in wealth who dwelt down by the bay,<br />
Must toil now with paupers for sixpence a-day;<br />
And oft, as I&rsquo;ve heard, has no morsel to chew:<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>The band by whose weapons the great C&aelig;sar died<br />
Were hunted by foes, and all peace were denied;<br />
Not one died the death of kind Nature, O, no!<br />
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>So it fared with the band by whom Willie did die,<br />
Their lands are a waste, their names stink to the sky;<br />
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>They melted like rime in the ruddy sun&rsquo;s glow:<br
/>
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>But comfort I take, for &rsquo;tis common report<br />
There are shoots of dear Will who are sitting at court,<br />
Who have punished his foes by king&rsquo;s mandate, although<br
/>
Thy murder, Brown William, fills Mona with woe.</p>
<p>O, &rsquo;tis pleasant to think, when one&rsquo;s
wither&rsquo;d and grey,<br />
There&rsquo;s race of Brown William in fair Ronaldsway,<br />
That his foemen are crush&rsquo;d, and their faces can&rsquo;t
show,<br />
While the clan of Christeen have no trouble or woe. <a

11</span>To the counsellors false, both in church and in
state,<br />
Bear the public of Mona both loathing and hate,<br />
Who set man against man, and the peace would break now,<br />
As thy murder, Brown William, broke hearts long ago.</p>
<p>The lord of our island, Duke Athol the great,<br />
They would gladly persuade, with their parle and their prate,<br
/>
The corner-stones high of his house to lay low,<br />
And to King, Duke and Mona are foemen, I trow.</p>

12</span>THE POWER OF THE HARP</h2>
<p>Sir Peter would forth from the castle ride,<br />
Grieving and weeping did sit his young bride.<br />

And allowed the young bride by herself to proceed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Belov&rsquo;d of my heart</i>, <i>wherefore

<p>And as the broad bridge she went galloping o&rsquo;er,<br />
Stumbled her steed on his golden shoes four.<br />

<p>Golden shoes four, each with golden nails three,<br />

But the bride she had sunk &rsquo;neath the waters high.<br />

18</span>THE UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>Hildebrand gave his sister away,<br />
Causing her many a mournful day.</p>
<p>She was given away and evilly wed,<br />
Joy from her bosom quickly fled.</p>
<p>On Sunday she was a graceful bride,<br />
On Monday a prisoner sad she sigh&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O what, my Lord, have I done to thee?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Woman, I had no gold with thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This have I, Dame, to say to thee,<br />
Thou brought&rsquo;st no silver home to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest I brought thee as my dower<br />
Eight full coffers to thy bower.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Two filled with silver, white to see,<br />
And two with gold so ruddy of blee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two filled with sable and mard skins rare,<br />
And two with pelts of deer and of bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon thy father I bestow&rsquo;d<br />
Gilded saddle and courser proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon thy mother did I bestow<br />
Scarlet to place her feet below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To thy brother a ship from off the wave,<br />
To your sister gold from my breast I gave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All thy courtiers I have dight<br />
With little shirts as ivory white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No serving lass in the house is there<br />
But I gave her silk to snood her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what, my Lord, canst me upbraid,<br />
And why in durance am I laid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, to thee I&rsquo;ve this to say,<br />
Thy brothers my father slew in fray.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;If my brothers a deed so dire did dare,<br />
I in that deed did in no ways share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou for thy father&rsquo;s death wast paid<br />
Seven tons of silver, and golden braid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more, my Lord, canst thou require,<br />
To remove from me thy anger dire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, with this I thee upbraid,<br />
Thou cam&rsquo;st not into my bed a maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So lend me, God, in my trouble aid,<br />
As I came into thy bed a maid!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may God never give me grace,<br />
If I came not a maid to thy embrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day thou shall sit within and mourn,<br />
To-morrow at dawn on faggots burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There she sits and her hands she wrings,<br />
Till she heard the clang of the Raven&rsquo;s wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Raven, Raven, stay thy wing,<br />
Can&rsquo;st thou the tune of the watchman sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;O well can I, and well I ought,<br />
So little was I when the tune I caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilt fly for me, Raven, to Tonne town,<br />
For there my friends and kindred wone?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee, Raven, a red gold band,<br />
To carry my message to Hildebrand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red gold band I&rsquo;ll give to thee,<br />
To tell him the tale of my misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy gold will do me little good,<br />
Dearer to me my raven food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Raven, if thou wilt fly for me,<br />
My husband&rsquo;s eyes shall be thy fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abroad his black wings the Raven threw,<br />
And over three kingly realms he flew.</p>
<p>The Raven into the chamber sped,<br />
Where Hildebrand drank the wine so red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, Hildebrand the young,<br />
Thy sister&rsquo;s into durance flung.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Here art thou sitting and drinking wine,<br />
To-morrow they&rsquo;ll burn sweet sister thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hildebrand sprang the table o&rsquo;er,<br />
Dashing the wine on the marble floor.</p>
<p>Hildebrand hies him into the stall,<br />
There he beholds the coursers all.</p>
<p>He viewed the brown, and the gray as well,<br />
On the black he laid the gilded selle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blacklille, Blacklille, if me thou&rsquo;lt bear,<br />
Thou on winnowed wheat all thy days shalt fare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then willingly, willingly, thee I&rsquo;ll bear,<br />
But to breathe my name thou must not dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed himself Blacklille&rsquo;s back upon,<br />
And across the sea then away he ran.</p>
<p>And when to the midst of the Sound they came,<br />
He in evil hour uttered Blacklille&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Blacklille quickly swam to the land,<br />
But down to the bottom sank Hildebrand.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>On the Ting stood the damsel at break of day,<br />
Then heard she afar off Blacklille neigh.</p>
<p>Blacklille ran towards the Ting in wrath,<br />
Back scattered both women and men from his path.</p>
<p>Blacklille he kicked, the Raven he hewed,<br />
With the blood of men was his beak embrued.</p>
<p>Black took on his back the fair young dame,<br />
He went from the Ting and with her was tame.</p>
<p>And when they reached the yellow sand,<br />
Upon it was standing Hildebrand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, sweet Kirsten, dear sister mine,<br />
Why is so pallid that cheek of thine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason my cheek so pale is seen,<br />
Is because I&rsquo;ve far from my dear home been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let no honest man,&rdquo; she said,<br />
&ldquo;Into foreign lands his daughter wed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of gold perhaps he may get a store,<br />
But her happiness goeth for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Hildebrand kissed her o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er:<br />
&ldquo;My darling sister, pray sorrow no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kirsten, I pray thee, pardon me<br />
For bringing thee into this misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then spake Blacklille as he stood:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve saved thee by shedding human blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me, Kirsten, one little kiss,<br />
And the Raven one on that beak of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their mouths she kissed them both with glee&mdash;<br />
From hideous thrall were they both set free.</p>
<p>She kissed them both with good will, I ween,<br />
They changed to her brothers who lost had been.</p>
<p>They all pressed her fondly to their breast,<br />
From sorrow and woe she is now at rest.</p>

25</span>THE WRESTLING-MATCH</h2>
<p>As one day I wandered lonely, in extreme distress of mind,<br
/>
I a pleasant garden entered, hoping comfort there to find.<br />
Up and down I paced the garden till an open space I spied,<br />
There I saw a crowd of people, and I heard a voice that cried:<br
/>
&ldquo;Come and see what Love is doing, here is Love performing
more<br />
Wondrous feats than e&rsquo;er were witnessed at Olympian games
of yore:<br />
This he conquers, that he conquers, young and old before him
lie,<br />
Great and small alike he conquers, none with him a fall must
try.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Hearing this at once I entered &rsquo;midst the crowd
collected there,<br />
Some of whom no doubt were eager like myself to banish care.<br
/>
I would fain behold this being, this same wondrous lad survey,<br
/>
Who &rsquo;twas said in each encounter bore with ease the prize
away.<br />
Quickly I the crowd divided, soon I pierced the multitude,<br />
And this Love stood full before me, and what think you
&rsquo;twas I view&rsquo;d?<br />
Why a boy, a little darling, full of captivating grace,<br />
Rather roguish were his glances, but how lovely was his face!</p>
<p>Soon as I beheld this warrior gibings I began to throw<br />
At the wretches who had suffered fell defeat from such a foe.<br
/>
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Then, to me his visage turning, of the conquered
standing by<br />
One replied, and in replying tears he shed abundantly:<br />
&ldquo;O, poor youth,&rdquo; &rsquo;twas thus he answered,
&ldquo;little, little dost thou know<br />
That in coming here thou comest not to joy, but bitter woe.<br />
Tears, and pains, and wounds most ghastly, wounds for which there
is no cure,<br />
Every kind of evil treatment such as no one can
endure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When these words I heard him utter I was filled with bitter
rage,<br />
And forthwith made preparation with the warrior to engage.<br />
&ldquo;Hearken, Master Love,&rdquo; I shouted, &ldquo;from this
spot stir not away,<br />
You and I must have a battle, must engage in deadly fray;<br />
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>That it may be known for certain which is strongest of
us two.&rdquo;<br />
Then into the arena bounding there I stood in all men&rsquo;s
view,<br />
In the midst of it expecting firm the onset of the foe,<br />
Doubting not should he attack me him at once to overthrow.<br />
Love he was not slow to follow with a blythe and joyous air,<br
/>
Crying out, &ldquo;My dearest fellow, for the fight yourself
prepare!<br />
Round the waist each other clasping now let&rsquo;s strive like
wrestlers true,<br />
Do your best and I will show you what young Master Love can
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then around the waist I clasped him, he his arms around me

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
